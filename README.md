# Face-recognition-Project
•	Constructed a Face recognition system by using HOG Algorithm as face identification Algorithm which identify people by creating gradient array from the face by concealing different sides of faces
•	Used Pyserial library to establish communication between Arduino and the computer system to
respond to the circuitry from the output of the system in form output displayed at LCD Display
•	Used pttsx and Datetime library to bring out voice output for greeting identified face by system at the specified time and synchronized the output of voice when more than two faces are identified
